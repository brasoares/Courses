Using the song “10 green bottles”, display the lines “There are [num] green bottles
hanging on the wall, [num] green bottles hanging on the wall, and if 1 green bottle
should accidentally fall”. Then ask the question “how many green bottles will be
hanging on the wall?” If the user answers correctly, display the message “There will be
[num] green bottles hanging on the wall”. If they answer incorrectly, display the
